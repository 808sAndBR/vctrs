The vctrs packages provides developer tools for working with existing vector classes (including logical, integer, double, character, list, factor, ordered, Date, POSIXct, difftime, and data.frame) as well as creating new vctors classes. It has two related goals:

1.  Through the `vec_type2()` and `vec_cast()` generics, define a consistent 
    set of principles that determine the return type of functions that have
    multiple input types (e.g. `c()`, `rbind()`, `ifelse()`). 
    
    See `vignette("function-types")` for more details.

1.  Through `new_vctr()` and `new_rcrd()`, make it easy to create new S3 vector
    classes whose behaviour can be defined my implementing just a handful of
    key methods.

    See `vignette("s3-vectors")` for more details.

vctrs is a developer focused package. Understanding and extending vctrs requires some effort from developers, but should be invisible to most users. It's our hope that having an underlying theory will mean that users can build up an accurate mental model without explicitly learning the theory. vctrs will typically be used by other packages, making it easy for them to provide new classes of S3 vectors that are supported throughout the tidyverse (and beyond). For that reason, vctrs has few dependencies.

## Installation

vctrs is not currently on CRAN. Install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-lib/vctrs")
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(vctrs)

vec_c(factor("a"), factor("b"))
vec_c(Sys.Date(), Sys.time())
```
