# vctrs

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/r-lib/vctrs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/r-lib/vctrs)
[![Coverage status](https://codecov.io/gh/r-lib/vctrs/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/r-lib/vctrs?branch=master)
[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

The primary short-term goal of vctrs is to develop a [type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) for vectors (including array and data frames) that help us reason about the "correct" type and shape to return from vectorised functions that combine inputs of different types (e.g. `c()`, `ifelse()`, `rbind()`). Our hope that this will make the package invisible for most users, instead of being suprised by the result of a function, a type _system_ will mean that you build up an accurate mental model just from day-to-day use.

Currently, the vctrs type system is fixed, and only works with types from base R (plus a handful of useful new types). In the medium-term, we will make the type system extensible, and document how to create new vector types that work with the type system. We will also reimplement the core coercions in C for performance, and consider how best to implemented the double dispatch needed for the core type system functions, `vec_cast()` and `vec_type2()`.

In the longer-term, vctrs will become the home for tidyverse vector functions that work with logical and numeric vectors, and vectors in general. This will make it a natural complement to [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org) (strings), [lubridate](http://lubridate.tidyverse.org) (date/times), and [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org) (factors), and will bring together various helpers that are currently scattered across packages, `ggplot2::cut_number()`, `dplyr::coalesce()`, and `tidyr::fill()`. 

vctrs has few dependencies and is suitable for use from other packages. (vctrs has a transition dependency on tibble. Once vctrs is extensible all tibble related code will move into the tibble package.)

## Installation

vctrs is not currently on CRAN. Install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-lib/vctrs")
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(vctrs)
```

### Base vectors

`vec_c()` works like `c()`, but has stricter coercion rules:

```{r, error = TRUE}
vec_c(TRUE, 1)
vec_c(1L, 1.5)
vec_c(1.5, "x")
```

Unlike `c()`, you can optionally specify the desired output type:

```{r}
vec_c(1, 2, .type = integer())
vec_c(1, "x", .type = character())
vec_c(1, "x", .type = list())
```

This supports a much wider range of casts (more on that below) than the automatic coercions, but it can still fail:

```{r, error = TRUE}
vec_c(Sys.Date(), .type = factor())
```

### What is a type?

There are a number of 1d types that built-in to base R and supported by vctrs: logical, integer, double, character, factor/ordered, date (`Date`), datetime (`POSIXct`), and time (`difftime`). You can get a textual representation of the type of a vector with `vec_type()`:

```{r}
vec_type(letters)
vec_type(1:50)
vec_type(list(1, 2, 3))
```

Internally, we represent the type of a vector with a 0-length subset of the vector; this allows us to use value and types interchangeably in many cases, and we can construct type specifications using base constructors (e.g, `double()`, `factor(levels = c("a", "b"))`).

### Coercion and casting

The vctrs type system is defined by two functions: `vec_type2()` and `vec_cast()`. `vec_type2()` is used for implicit coercions: given two types, it returns their common type, or an error stating that there's no common type. 

```{r, error = TRUE}
vec_type2(integer(), double())

# no common type
vec_type2(factor(), Sys.Date())
```

`vec_type2()` is associative and commutative, so if you have more than two types, you can use `Reduce()` to find the common type:

```{r}
types <- list(integer(), double(), logical())
Reduce(vec_type2, types)
```

`vec_cast()` is used for explicit casts: given a value and a type, it casts the value to the type or throws an error stating that the cast is not possible. If a cast is possible in general (i.e. double -> integer), but information is lost for a specific input (e.g. 1.5 -> 1), it will generate a warning.

```{r, error = TRUE}
# Cast succeeds
vec_cast(c(1, 2), integer())

# Cast loses information
vec_cast(c(1.5, 2.5), integer())

# Cast fails
vec_cast(c(1.5, 2.5), factor("a"))
```

The set of possible casts is a subset of possible automatic coercions. The following diagram summarises both casts (arrows) and coercions (circles) for all base types supported by vctrs:

### Data frames

vctrs defines the type of a data frame as the type of each column labelled with the name of the column:

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(x = TRUE, y = 1L)
vec_type(df1)

df2 <- data.frame(x = 1, z = 1)
vec_type(df2)
```

The common type of two data frames is the common type of each column that occurs in both data frame frames, and the union of the columns that only occur in one:

```{r}
vec_type(vec_type2(df1, df2))
```

### List of

vctr provides a new vector type that represents a list where each element has the same type (an interesting contrast to a data frame which is a list where each element has the same _length_).

```{r, error = TRUE}
x1 <- list_of(1:3, 3:5, 6:8)
vec_type(x)

# This type is enforced if you attempt to modify the vector
x1[[4]] <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
x1[[4]]

x1[[5]] <- factor("x")
```

This provides a natural type for nested data frames:

```{r}
vec_type(as_list_of(split(mtcars, mtcars$cyl)))
```

## Compared to base R

The following section compares base R and vctrs behavour. Changing base R to follow the same set of principles as vctrs would lead to widespread breakage in existing code, especially given that `c()` is often used for its side-effect of stripping attributes (e.g. `?POSIXct` suggests using `c(x)` to strip the time zone attribute).

### Atomic vectors

```{r, error = TRUE}
# c() will coerce any atomic type to character
c(1, "x")

# vctrs is stricter, and only casts explicitly
vec_c(1, "x")

vec_c(1, "x", .type = character())
```

### Factors

```{r}
fa <- factor("a")
fb <- factor("b")

# c() strips all factor attributes giving an integer vector
c(fa, fb)

# while unlist() creates a new factor with the union of the levels 
unlist(list(fa, fb))

# vctrs always unions the levels
vec_c(fa, fb)
```

### Dates and date-times

```{r}
date <- as.Date("2020-01-01")
datetime <- as.POSIXct("2020-01-01 09:00")

# If the first argument to c() is a date, the result is a date
# But the datetime is not converted correctly (the number of seconds
# in the datetime is interpreted as the number of days in the date)
c(date, datetime)

# If the first argument to c() is a datetime, the result is a datetime
# But the date is not converted correctly (the number of days in the
# date is interpreted as the number of seconds in the date)
c(datetime, date)

# vctrs always returns the same type regardless of the order
# of the arguments, and converts dates to datetimes at midnight
vec_c(datetime, date)
vec_c(date, datetime)
```

### Data frames

```{r, error = TRUE}
df1 <- data.frame(x = TRUE)
df2 <- data.frame(y = 2)

# rbind() requires the inputs to have identical column names
rbind(df1, df2)

# vctrs creates a common type that is the union of the columns
vec_rbind(df1, df2)

# Additionally, you can specify the desired output type
vec_rbind(df1, df2, .type = data.frame(x = double(), y = double()))
```

### Tibbles

```{r}
tb1 <- tibble::tibble(x = 3)

# rbind() uses the class of the first argument
class(rbind(tb1, df1))
class(rbind(df1, tb1))

# vctrs uses the common class of all arguments
class(vec_rbind(df1, df1))
class(vec_rbind(tb1, df1))
class(vec_rbind(df1, tb1))

# (this will help the tidyverse avoid turning data frames
# into tibbles when you're not using them)
```

## Tidyverse functions

There are a number of tidyverse functions that currently need to do type coercion. In the long run, their varied and idiosyncratic approaches will be replaced by the systematic foundation provided by vctrs.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Data frame functions
dplyr::inner_join() # and friends
dplyr::bind_rows()
dplyr::summarise()
dplyr::mutate()

tidyr::gather()
tidyr::unnest()

# Vector functions
purrr::flatten()
purrr::map_c()
purrr::transpose()

dplyr::combine()
dplyr::if_else()
dplyr::recode()
dplyr::case_when()
dplyr::coalesce()
dplyr::na_if()
```
