The goal of the vctrs package is to expose and standardise the vector interface that sits at the heart of the R language. The vctrs framework implements consistent combinations of vectors with well defined and extensible coercion rules. Thanks to the consistency and genericity of the vctrs framework, you can work with vectors in a robust and predictable way.

Because the vctrs interface is well defined and generic, it makes it easy to define your own vector classes with minimal efforts. Like base classes, these custom vector classes interact consistently and predictably with the rest of the language.

To make this possible, vctrs provides tools to think about function invariants, properties of function that always true, regardless of the inputs. The vctrs framework focusses on invariants related to R's vector data structures, partitioning their properties into two main components: a size and a prototype. This allows us to analyse properties of a function API, without having to think about the implementation.

For example, we might say that a function like `c()` should have two properties: 

* the size of the output should equal the sum of size of the inputs.
  i.e. `vec_size(vec_c(x, y))` equals `vec_size(x) + vec_size(y)`

* the type of the output shouldn't be affected by the order of the inputs.
  i.e. `vec_type(vec_c(x, y))` equals `vec_type(vec_c(y, x))`

vctrs is a developer focused package. Understanding and extending vctrs requires some effort from developers, but should be invisible to most users. It's our hope that having an underlying theory will mean that users can build up an accurate mental model without explicitly learning the theory. vctrs will typically be used by other packages, making it easy for them to provide new classes of S3 vectors that are supported throughout the tidyverse (and beyond). For that reason, vctrs has few dependencies.

## Installation

vctrs is not currently on CRAN. Install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-lib/vctrs")
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(vctrs)

vec_c(factor("a"), factor("b"))
vec_c(Sys.Date(), Sys.time())
```
