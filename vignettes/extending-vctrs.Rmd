This vignette describes how you can add your own S3 vector class to the vctrs type system. I assume that you have already understand the basics of the [S3 system][S3], and you have an S3 vector class with at least:

* A `print()` method

* A `[` method that preserves class.

* A zero-length representation that can be constructed with `x[0]` and 
  prints informatively.

Your vector class must curently be built on top of an existing base vector type (logical, integer, double, character, or list). vctrs currently does not support vector types built on other foundations, or that provide custom `names()` or `length()` methods.

```{r}
library(vctrs)
```

Please note that the API (particularly function and argument names) described in this vignette is highly likely to change in the future. Expect some modification as we learn from external developers what could be improved.

## Binned

To make the discussion of the ideas in this vignette concrete, I'm going to provide a simple vector class of my own. The `binned` class stores a double vector along with a vector of breaks, and uses these when printing. It's kind of like a factor, but for doubles.

```{r}
new_binned <- function(x, breaks) {
  stopifnot(is.double(x))
  
  structure(
    x, 
    breaks = breaks,
    class = "binned"
  )
}

#' @export
print.binned <- function(x) {
  cat("<binned>\n")
  
  # Rely on factor printing as much as possible
  f <- cut(x, attr(x, "breaks"))
  print(as.integer(f))
  cat("Bins: ", paste0(levels(f), collapse = ", "))
  
  invisible(x)
}

#' @export
`[.binned` <- function(x, i, ...) {
  new_binned(NextMethod(), breaks = attr(x, "breaks"))
}

x <- new_binned(runif(10), seq(0, 1, length = 5))
x

x[1]

x[0]
```

## Coercion

`vec_type2()` defines the possible set of automatic, or implicit, coercions. Because these coercions happen silently, they are quite strict; if they're too flexible, they'll increase the likelihood of silent mistakes. It's useful to look at coercions that vctrs provides for base types, as we think about _why_ these coercions exist, and how you should think about coercions for your own class.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/coerce.png")
```

If you squint your brain a little, I think you can see that each set of automatic coercions is about increasing resolution. Integers are low resolution versions of doubles, and dates are low resolution versions of date-times. Logicals are low resolution version of integers because there's a strong convention that `TRUE` and `FALSE` can be used interchangeably with `1` and `0`. 

But what is the resolution of a factor? We must take a somewhat pragmatic approach because base R often converts character vectors to factors, and we don't want to be burdensome to users. So we say that a factor `x` has finer resolution than factor `y` if the levels of `y` are contained in `x`. So to find the common type of two factors, we take the union of the levels of both factors, resulting in a factor that has finer resolution than either. Finally, you can think of a character vector as a factor with every possible level, so factors and character vectors are coercible.

Using this reasoning, I think binned should only be coercible with doubles, as you can think of a double as a binned vector with inifinitely small bins.

### Double dispatch

The implementation of `vec_type2()` relies on __double dispatch__, because the result depends on the type of both arguments. S3 does not have native support for double dispatch, but we can implement with a trick: doing dispatch twice. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vec_type2 <- function(x, y) {
  UseMethod("vec_type2")
}
vec_type2.integer <- function(x, y) {
  UseMethod("vec_type2.integer", y)
}
vec_type2.integer.double <- function(x, y) {
  double()
}
```

This means that we can two levels of generics `vec_type2()` and `vec_type2.XYZ()` with the interesting property that `vec_type2.XYZ()` is both an S3 method _and_ an S3 generic.

To make this a bit more concrete, when you call `vec_type2(1L, 1)` the sequence of calls is:

* `vec_type2()`
* `vec_type2.integer()`
* `vec_type2.integer.double()`

If you call `vec_type2(1, 1L)` the sequence of calls is quite different:

* `vec_type2()`
* `vec_type2.double()`
* `vec_type2.double.integer()`

`vec_type2.x.y()` must return the same value as `vec_type2.y.x()`, but unfortunately there's no way to enforce this at the language level. Instead we need to use strong conventions (always defining the pair of methods next to each other), and unit tests to make sure that the system is well founded.

### Extending binned

Now that you understand the principles governing which coercions should exist, and the basic idea behind `vec_type2()`, we can implement coercions for the binned class. 

First, we create `vec_type2.binned()`:

```{r}
vec_type2.binned <- function(x, y) {
  UseMethod("vec_type2.binned", y)
} 
```

(We'll come back to how to manage this in your package `NAMESPACE` a little later.)

Next, we add two methods to `vec_type2.binned()` that must always exist:

*   `NULL` is idempotent (i.e. `vec_type2(x, NULL)` is always `x`), so 
    you must provide a `NULL` method that returns a vector of the same type as 
    `x`, but with zero length. 
  
    ```{r}
    vec_type2.binned.NULL <- function(x, y) {
      x[0L]
    }
    ```
  
*   A default method that throws an informative error if there is no common type 
    for a pair of types. Use `stop_incompatible_type()` to get a standard 
    message. This function also uses a [custom condition][custom-condition]
    which you can test for with `expect_error(class = "error_incompatible_type")`.

    ```{r}
    vec_type2.binned.default <- function(x, y) {
      stop_incompatible_type(x, y)
    }
    ```

Now we can provide the meat of our implementation, ensuring that the common type of double and binned is double. We need a pair of methods for the two possible orders of the argument.

```{r}
vec_type2.binned.double <- function(x, y) double()
vec_type2.double.binned <- function(x, y) double()

vec_type2(x, 1.5)
vec_type2(1.5, x)
```

We also need to handle the binned <-> binned case. We take the same approach as for factors, taking the union of the breaks.

```{r}
union_breaks <- function(x, y) {
  x_breaks <- attr(x, "breaks")
  y_breaks <- attr(y, "breaks")
  
  sort(union(x_breaks, y_breaks))
}

vec_type2.binned.binned <- function(x, y) {
  new_binned(double(), breaks = union_breaks(x, y))
}

y <- new_binned(c(1, 5, 10), breaks = c(0, 2.5, 5, 7.5))
vec_type2(x, y)
```

## Casting

`vec_cast()` defines the possible set user-requested coercions, or casts. Because these are user initiated, the set of possible casts is much larger than the set of possible coercions. The following diagram shows the set of casts that vctrs provides for base classes. If you can follow arrows in the same direction from one class to another, then a cast exists.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/cast.png")
```

Note that the arrows are bidirectional: if you can cast from `x` to `y`, you should also be able to cast back from `y` to `x`. If type `x` has greater resolution than `y`, there will be some inputs that lose precision. These should generate warnings using `warn_cast_lossy()`:

```{r}
vec_cast(c(1, 2, 10), to = integer())

vec_cast(c(1.5, 2, 10.5), to = integer())
```

Generally, you should provide a cast method whenever it's meaningful to cast back and forth from a given type. For binned vectors, I think this is only true for doubles and lists.

### Extending binned

Like `vec_type2()`, `vec_cast()` uses double dispatch, so the initial steps are similar. We start by creating the generic, and providing `NULL` and `default` methods. 

```{r}
vec_cast.binned <- function(x, to) {
  UseMethod("vec_cast.binned")
}

vec_cast.binned.NULL <- function(x, to) {
  NULL
}

vec_cast.binned.default <- function(x, to) {
  stop_incompatible_cast(x, to)
}
```

Note that the order of dispatch is different to `vec_type2()`. Here the second argument, `to`, forms the first component of the function name, i.e. `vec_cast.binned.NULL()` casts a `NULL` vector to `binned`. This makes sense if you think about `as.integer()`, `as.double()` etc.

There is one extra method that you should always provide for `vec_cast()`: the ability to round trip to and from a list. To cast your vector to a list, implement a `as.list()` method, which can always follow the simple form show below. To cast from a list back to you class, use the `vec_list_cast()` helper provided by vctrs.

```{r}
as.list.binned <- function(x, ...) {
  lapply(seq_along(x), function(i) x[i])
}

vec_cast.list.binned <- function(x, to) as.list(x)
vec_cast.binned.list <- function(x, to) cast_from_list(x, to)
```

Need make sure that your object can cast to itself:

```{r}
vec_cast.binned.binned <- function(x, to) {
  new_binned(as.vector(x), breaks = attr(x, "breaks"))
}
```

Finish up by providing an other casts. For binned, we need to describe how to cast from binned to double and double to binned:

```{r}
vec_cast.binned.double <- function(x, to) {
  # using as.vector() for its purpose of stripping attributes
  as.vector(x)
}

vec_cast.double.binned <- function(x, to) {
  new_binned(x, breaks = attr(to, "breaks"))
}
```

You can then confirm that `vec_type2()` and `vec_cast()` are plumbed together correctly by using `vec_c()`:

```{r}
vec_c(x[1], 0.5)

vec_c(0.5, .type = x)

vec_c(x[1], 0.5, .type = x)
```

## Namespaces

The namespace declarations are a little clunky because (e.g.) `vec_cast.binned()` is both a generic (which must be exported so that others can provide methods) and an S3 method (which must be registered). This problem wasn't considered in the design of roxygen2, so you have to be quite explicit:

```{r}
#' @export
#' @method vec_cast binned
#' @export vec_cast.binned
vec_cast.binned <- function(x, y) {
} 
```

You also need to register the individual double-dispatch methods. Unfortuantely roxygen's heuristic for determing the name of the generic from the name of the method gives the wrong result here, so you need to fully specify it:

```{r}
#' @method vec_cast.binned double
#' @export
vec_cast.binned.double <- function(x, y) {
}
```

Hopefully future versions of roxygen will make these exports less painful.
