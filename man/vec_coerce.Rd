\title{Coerce vectors to shared type}
\usage{
vec_coerce(..., .type = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Vectors to coerce.}

\item{.type}{Usually, the type of the output is coerced to a type common to
inputs. Alternatively, you can supply \code{.type} to force the output to
have known type, or to die trying. See \code{\link[=vec_cast]{vec_cast()}} for more details.
\code{.type = character()} and \code{.type = list()} will succeed for all vectors.}
}
\value{
A list of input vectors coerced to shared (least-upper-bound) type,
or an error stating that a common type could not be found.
}
\description{
This function is a general tool that will be of most interest when developing
new functions, but it also serves as a central place to document design
decisions. See \code{\link[=vec_c]{vec_c()}} for an application of these principles.

\section{Coercion rules}{


vctrs thinks of the vector types as forming a partially ordered set, or
poset. Then finding the common type from a set of types is a matter of
finding the least-upper-bound; if the least-upper-bound does not exist,
there is no common type. This is the case for many pairs of 1d vectors.

The poset of the most important base vectors is shown below:
(where datetime stands for \code{POSIXt}, and date for \code{Date})

\examples{
vec_coerce(factor("a"), factor(c("a", "b")))
vec_coerce(factor("a"), Sys.Date(), .type = list())
