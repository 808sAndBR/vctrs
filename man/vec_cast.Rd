}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector to cast.}

\item{to}{Type to cast to.}
}
\value{
A vector the same length as \code{x} with the same type as \code{to},
or an error if the cast is not possible. A warning is generated if
information is lost when casting between compatible types (i.e. when
there is no 1-to-1 mapping for a specific value).
}
\description{
\code{vec_cast()} provides general coercions from one type of vector to another,
and along with \code{\link[=vec_type2]{vec_type2()}} forms the foundation of the vctrs type system.
It should generally not be called by R users, but is important for R
developers.

\section{Casting rules}{

Casting is more flexible than coercion, and allows for the possibility of
information loss. This diagram summarises possible coercions. \code{vec_cast()}
from any type connected to another type, provided that the arrows are
followed in only one direction. For example you can cast from logical to
character, and list to time, but you can not cast from logical to datetime.

\figure{cast.png}

Most casts are not symmetric: you can cast all integers to doubles, but you
can only cast a subset of doubles back to integers. If a cast is potentially
lossy, a warning message will be shown whenever an actual loss occurs
(which may only be for some elements of a vector).

The rules for coercing from a list are fairly strict: each component of the
list must be of length 1, and must be coercible to type \code{to}. This ensures
that a round-trip to and form list is possible, without opening the door
to very flexible list flattening (which should be the job of a more
specialised function).
}

\section{S3 dispatch}{

\code{vec_cast()} dispatches on both arguments because casting depends on both
the type of \code{x} and of \code{to}. This is implemented by having methods of
\code{vec_cast()}, e.g. \code{vec_cast.integer()} also be S3 generics, which call
e.g. \code{vec_cast.integer.double()}.

Note that \code{vec_cast()} dispatch on its second argument, so that the name
of the final method uses the same convention as \code{as.xyz()} methods, i.e.
\code{vec_cast.integer.double()} casts double to integers, in the same way
that \code{as.integer.double()} would.

See \code{vignette("s3-vector")} on how to extend to your own S3
vector classes.

\examples{
# x is a double, but no information is lost
vec_cast(1, integer())

# Information is lost so a warning is generated
vec_cast(1.5, integer())

# No sensible coercion is possible so an error is generated
\dontrun{
vec_cast(1.5, factor("a"))
}
