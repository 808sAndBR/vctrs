> # Can't mix negative and missing locations
> vec_as_location(-c(1L, NA), 30)
Error: Negative subscripts can't have missing locations.
i The subscript has a missing value at location 2.

> vec_as_location(-c(1L, rep(NA, 10)), 30)
Error: Negative subscripts can't have missing locations.
i The subscript has 10 missing values at locations 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...

> # Can't mix negative and missing locations
> vec_as_location(c(-1L, 1L), 30)
Error: Negative subscripts can't be mixed with positive locations.
i The subscript has a positive value at location 2.

> vec_as_location(c(-1L, rep(1L, 10)), 30)
Error: Negative subscripts can't be mixed with positive locations.
i The subscript has 10 missing values at locations 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...

> # Negative forbidden
> num_as_location(dbl(1, -1), 2L, negative = "error")
Error: Must subset with a proper subscript vector.
x `i` contains negative locations.
i These subscripts must be positive integers.

> vec_as_location(c(TRUE, FALSE), 3)
Error: Logical subscripts must match the size of the indexed vector.
i The indexed vector has size 3.
x The subscript has size 2.
