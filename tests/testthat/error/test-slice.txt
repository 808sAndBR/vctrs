Unnamed vector with character subscript
=======================================

> vec_slice(1:3, letters[1])
Error: Can't use character names to index an unnamed vector.


Negative subscripts are checked
===============================

> vec_slice(1:3, -c(1L, NA))
Error: Negative locations can't have missing values.
i The subscript has a missing value at location 2.

> vec_slice(1:3, c(-1L, 1L))
Error: Negative locations can't be mixed with positive locations.
i The subscript has a positive value at location 2.


oob error messages are properly constructed
===========================================

x Can't subset location 3.
i There are only 2 elements.

> vec_slice(c(bar = 1), "foo")
Error: Must index existing elements.

> # Multiple OOB indices
> vec_slice(letters, c(100, 1000))
