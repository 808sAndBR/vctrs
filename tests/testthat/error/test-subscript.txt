Error: Must subset with a proper subscript vector.
x `i` has the wrong type `integer`.
i The subscript must contain names.

> vec_as_subscript("foo", indicator = "error", name = "error")
Error: Must subset with a proper subscript vector.
x `i` has the wrong type `character`.
i The subscript must contain locations.

> vec_as_subscript(TRUE, indicator = "error")
Error: Must subset with a proper subscript vector.
x `i` has the wrong type `logical`.
i The subscript must contain locations or names.

> vec_as_subscript("foo", name = "error")
